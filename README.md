In today's world, data is crucial for many systems to function effectively. However, there's often a lack of real-time data, which hinders these systems.

This project suggests creating a system to collect real-time data about traffic on roads.
To tackle challenges like distributing the system, improving machine learning accuracy, and automating processes, 
we'll use virtualization, ensemble learning, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) techniques.

The data we gather will help urban planners understand traffic patterns in different road sections. Our solution is affordable, easy to maintain, and has minimal delays.
